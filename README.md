# VPS Setup

This repository contains commands and scripts I end up running on some VPSs to get em up and running. 

Decided to collect theme here so its easy to refer to, maybe it'll help someone else.

## Montioring

The [monitoring](./monitoring/README.md) section contains setup steps for stuff like Prometheus/Grafana and other stuff to monitor servers and stuff. 

## Tinyproxy

The [tinyproxy](./tinyproxy/README.md) section has guidance on how to setup an HTTP(s) proxy, useful to hide traffic from ISPs or other censors.
